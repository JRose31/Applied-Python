# 1. April Flight Tracker
## This script was created in order to sift through up to 100 flight numbers and passenger counts.
## There were some repeated flight numbers with updated passenger counts so this script iterated
## through this csv file and extracted each unique flight number with the most up to date passenger counts.
#### *This script was utilized in a non-technical work environment to save myself and my peers time*
